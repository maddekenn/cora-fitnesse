Everything in the system is a recordType. If we want to be able to store information about a book in the system, we need to create a recordType for book.

'''Metadata'''

The recordType defines two metadata groups, one for creating a new instance of the recordType, and one for updating an existing instance. 

The metadata groups are the definition of the data needed to create and update an instance of that recordType. One essential part of those top level metadata groups are a child group with name in data recordInfo. The system expect this child group to exist and it expects it to contain:

-Â  an atomic value with name in data "id" (optional in metadata group for new if id is to be auto generated)

- a metadata record link with name in data "type" which links to record type recordType (NOT present in metadata group for new, just in metadata group for existing)

- a metadata record link with name in data "datadivider" which links to record type system

- an atomic value with name in data "tscreated" (NOT present in metadata group for new, just in metadata group for existing)

- a metadata record link with name in data "createdBy" (NOT present in metadata group for new, just in metadata group for existing)
